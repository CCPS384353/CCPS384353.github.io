    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am currently taking many high-end courses to meet the requirements of graduating high school. I want to have all of my credits early so I can have a more open schedule in my future. Seeing my sister have this freedom is one of the main reasons I strive for the luxury of sleeping in in the morning. By taking and passing all the courses I have set in place for myself I hope to surpass the requirements and afford my self a more diverse arrangement of classes. I am putting extra care into my courses and studying to make sure I pass.
 A hard work ethic and a dream keep in on track but values like commitment to my future are gravely important. The values of myself will keep me on track and push me forward.
I hope to accomplish many achievements in my future days ahead. The one I’m most excited for is the lifeguard course in which I hope to soon pass.
I want to be known most for an outstanding record and financial stability. I also want to be known for fairness and accountability. Theses qualities will help define the person I’m remembered as and how my future employer or employes will view me as.
